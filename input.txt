He tends to take money up front to "buy" parts needed and then he never buys the parts, never does the repairs and will not return the money he stole. WATCH OUT!! If you decide to hire Rob S make sure he has done all the work you want done correctly before giving him any money. If you don't you will be in the same situation I have been in for the past year. He took money to buy the parts that my RV needed, NEVER did any repairs and actually damaged my RV and to top it if used the new refrigerator I purchased for his personal use in his home. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!! I will continue to post BEWARE of the ripoff until he returns the money he took from me and did not do any repairs!!!So, just for you ROB, I will not quit posting...... He is at least admitting to people he has ripped of others......WHY WOULD ANYONE HIRE HIM?

http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/rvs/3701341248.html Part GENERATOR MULTIQUIP GENERATOR - $3200 (Wills Point) MULTIQUIP GENERATOR , GA-9.7 HE 9700,This is a Commercial Grade work horse. I bought this generator to run my RV during Hurricane season, I used it for 3 days until I was able to connect to direct power at an RV Park. This Generator retails for $ 5,500.00 at MULTIQUIP and a few other places , It has little use on it and starts first time everytime , optional pull start as well as battery start , my RV is 40 feet and requires a 50 AMP Hook up and I had no problems at all . I have part of the paperwork and a PDF Manuel can be downloaded for free off the internet . It probably could stand an oil change but other than that it,s in perfect running condition. Notice that the bottom is a 10 gallon fuel tank and thats a plus due to people forgetting to shut off the fuel before traveling , every time you hit the slightest bump on an overhead fuel tank the fuel float in the carb bounces and allows fuel to run down into the cylender and then into the crankcase , then when you start it not realizeing that all the fuel has deluted the oil and then destroys the cylender in a very short time. There is a wheel kit for this generator that can be purchased at a number of company,s. The reason I did not buy one was due to theft , I had it chained down in the bed of my truck. SCAMMERS NOT WELCOME, YOU WILL BE REPORTED AS SOON AS YOU SEND ME THE STUPID ATTEMPTS YOU TRY.

This motorhome is a great buy the interior is very good and it runs and drives like new. It cost over $90,000 when it was new. I purchased from an insurance auction just to resale, everthing is good except some exterior cosmetic problems. the exterior looks like it was in some heat. It has some wavey places and minor cracks. I believe it was close to the forest fire down in Bastrop because that is where it came from. You can not tell anything wrong with it from 50 feet away. This is a bargain for someone needing a motorhome who can live with it not looking perfect. Everything is working and it has the hydraulic leveling from driver seat, very quiet generator with 326 hrs. on it. The motor is a ford v10 and sounds better than any motor I have ever heard. It has plenty of power, cruised at 65 mph no problem. One superslide and the tires look new. This RV will have a rebuilt salvage title. $19,500

Streak B Gone put an end to that misery. If you have never tried this stuff, you will be amazed. There is no dealer here in Dallas so I sell it from my home. This equates to savings for a consumer who wants to see his RV streak free. I sell a gallon for $24. Can deliver within a 10 mile radius of Rowlett. Fifty cents per mile beyond 10 miles.

http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/rvs/3699985015.html Towable 2006 30' Frontier Travel Trailer - $9500 (Bailey, TX) I purchased this camper 3 years ago from a dealer. It had been purchased to be used as a FEMA trailer, but did not appear to have ever been lived in. I have used it as my weekend home for 2 1/2 years. I am living elsewhere now and no longer have use for it. I have lots of pictures that aren't posted. So let me know if you want to see more. There is a couple of small issues with the camper. All but one were present when I bought the camper. The one that is not is the refrigerator. It works fine on Propane, but the electrical board was damaged and needs replaced. This occurred after I had moved it. The guy accidently crossed the battery cables when we were trying to get the slide to move out. A new board runs about $300. The other issues are the lighting. Two of the lights on the slide don't work. I've been told the wiring under the slide sometimes becomes disconnected, but I haven't checked it out. Just haven't needed them. The other and final issue is, when I purchased the camper, it had a small leak in the front bedroom about the right side window. The only damage is to the paper on the wall covering. I've got pictures of it. I have looked for the leak and not sure where it is. I haven't had the time to look into fixing it. I keep it under a carport, which is for sale also if interested. The tires do have dry rot and I will replace those with some good ones. The tires haven't concerned me because I haven't been using it for a travel trailer. Just wanting to be honest and upfront about my rv. It's been a good one and has very few signs of any wear. Take a look at the pics and if interested, give me a call. If you want more pics, give me your email and I will send more. I am only home on the weekends. I travel, so if you call and don't reach me, leave a message and I will return your call. I work in an area that has poor cell phone service. Thanks for looking. 903-438-8208
